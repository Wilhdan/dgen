### Disclaimer

%{company} notes that %{assessment_type}s are limited in a number of aspects:

* They are conducted with limited resources over a limited period of time. An attacker may not face the same constraints.
* They are a point in time assessment. Changes to the security landscape including the discovery of new vulnerabilities, attack techniques, and changes in the %{target_name} 's configuration may lead to new vulnerabilities over time.
* They are performed in a specific environemnt. There may be differences in configuration between the environment assessed and others.

As a result, %{company} gives no guarantee, warranty, or assurance that the services it has performed and provided pursuant to the assessment will have the effect of:

* Identifying an exhaustive list of all threats and risks to the Client’s systems;
* Documenting all possible controls that might be applied to remediate identified threats and risks; and or
* Being continually accurate and relevant as threats and risks as identified by the Vendor (and any recommended controls) may be time specific.

Threats and risks to assessed systems and controls that have been implemented to remediate such risks and threats should be reviewed regularly to ensure their currency and efficacy.
